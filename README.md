1. Introduction
 1.1 Project Overview
   
Quantum Sudoku is an innovative twist on the classic Sudoku puzzle game, incorporating quantum mechanics principles like superposition
and entanglement. This Python-based game challenges players to solve puzzles where cells can exist in multiple states simultaneously until "collapsed" to a definite value.

1.2 Objectives

Create an engaging Sudoku variant with quantum mechanics elements
Implement core quantum concepts (superposition, entanglement)
Develop clear win/lose conditions and scoring
Provide adjustable difficulty levels
Design an intuitive graphical interface

3. Game Features
2.1 Core Mechanics
   
Quantum Superposition: Cells can hold multiple possible values
Entanglement: Linked cells that affect each other's collapse
Logic Moves: Special moves that bypass normal rules (10 per game)
Mistake Tracking: Counts invalid moves (excluding logic moves)

2.2 Gameplay Elements
